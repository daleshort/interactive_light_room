# Interactive Light Room

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My senior project in college was an interactive projector wall installation in NYC PS347, a school catering to deaf children.  I used an xbox kinect and some computer vision software and wrote two programs in C++.  One was an interactive fish tank (I drew the fish and plants) and the other was built on existing FFT sound visualizer code, but I adapted the visualization to react to your body movements.</p>
